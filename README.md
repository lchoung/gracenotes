15-112 Project (Fall '13)

grace \\ notes is a game I created in Python for my term project in 15-112.

The gameplay consists of dodging obstacles that fly across the screen by singing notes.
The program records the player's voice and analyzes its pitch in real time, and moves the character's sprite up and down the screen according to the pitch sung.
